# What is Flyover Indies?

Flyover Indies is a community of indie game developers based in the Kansas City area. We champion one another through our individual game development journeys and celebrate new voices in the KC game dev scene. Our community is open to local game creators from all experience levels and backgrounds, including developers, designers, artists, musicians, and anyone with an interest in game development or games-adjacent fields. Flyover Indies supports game makers of all types of games: videogames, board games, card games, or whatever!

Flyover Indies strives to be a welcoming, safe, and accessible community for everyone, so all our events are free to attend and there are no membership fees to join.

Originally founded in 2014 under the name Crossroads Game Lab, in 2017 we adopted our current name, Flyover Indies.
