# Mentors

Mentors are more experienced members of Flyover Indies, they are role models in the community and have previously served as an Organizer. Mentors are the leadership of Flyover Indies.

Anyone who was an Organizer and successfully completed their project can apply to become a Mentor. Mentors help guide Organizers in their action plans, and assist however they can to make them a success, which includes reviewing and accepting pitches. Mentors also help with general community facilitation and keep Flyover Indies accountable to its mission and conduct standards. Applications are reviewed by both Organizers and Mentors.

6 months after successfully completing your last project your role resets to Member. This is meant to keep the leadership in the organization organic. Anyone actively pursuing another project, maintaining an ongoing one, or helping with others' projects will be exempt from this. You can apply as many times as you like, and can be a Mentor more than once.
