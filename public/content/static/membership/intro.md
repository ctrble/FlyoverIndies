The Flyover indies is a community led organization. This means that anyone, so long as they put in the work and respect our values, can become a part of our leadership. If you have an idea for a great game related or development related project or event, join our community and we help to make it happen!

Joining Flyover Indies is free and as easy as becoming a Member of our Discord. If you're interested in helping out and contributing more to the community by running events or bringing something else to the group, you then can apply to be an Organizer or Mentor!
