# Friends of Flyover Indies

You're in luck! There are more great game development communities in the Kansas City area, here are a few we think are especially friendly, fun, and helpful:

- [Amber Waves of Games](https://www.amberwavesofgames.com/?ref=flyoverindies)
- [KC Game Designers](https://sites.google.com/site/kcgamedesigners/?ref=flyoverindies)

If you're looking for more game dev communities in the Midwest, we're fans of these awesome organizations, too:
