# Organizers

Organizers help Flyover Indies by doing projects for the community, such as planning events like game jams or discussion groups, running a workshop to teach others a new skill, and generally driving Flyover Indies forward to new adventures.

Anyone can pitch an actionable idea for the benefit of the community. Other Organizers and Mentors will review the idea to make sure it's attainable and in line with our values. You can also group up with others to work as a team, or add people to the team as the project goes on, and any Member that joins a team will become an Organizer.

6 months after successfully completing your last project your role resets to Member. This is meant to keep the leadership in the organization organic. Anyone actively pursuing another project, maintaining an ongoing one, or helping with others' projects will be exempt from this. You can apply as many times as you like, and can be an Organizer more than once.
