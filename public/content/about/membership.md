# Membership

Flyover Indies is primarily comprised of Members, it's free to become one and as easy as joining our Discord! We welcome anyone of any experience or skill level who has an interest in game development or a field adjacent to game development, like design, writing, art, or music.

Whether you've never made a game before, or you're a seasoned AAA veteran, you'll find a welcoming and friendly community with Flyover Indies. An interest in game making is what ties us together. Our only expectation of Members is that you follow our Code of Conduct.
